# Password Generator

The basic idea of the app is to generate strong random password for the user that are difficult to decrypt. The generated password can be customized as per the requirement of the user with the help of settings.

## Overview
This app generates random password for users. The random password may include Uppercase or lowercase alphabets, numbers, spaces, special characters, or can even have any self defined prefixes. The user can also set the length of the password. The idea of this project is to create passwords that are secure and impossible to crack. As the passwords are randomly generated and hard to remember the user can also save the password with a name in this app, say Facebook, so that he remembers that this password is my Facebook’s password. In order to avoid other people from looking in our app and get our saved password from it, we have implemented and access control for logging in into our app. The login mechanism is covered by Sqlite database. The saved password are also protected with Pattern lock for more security, the library andrognito pattern lock view is used for setting an pattern. There is also a Facebook login on the login screen of the app, user can login into this custom Facebook page by his secure generated password  if he don’t want to login with his password for security.


The main screen comprises of main objective i.e. password is generated. Random password can be generated by hitting the GENERATE button. There are three buttons below the Generate button viz, Copy, Save, Share.

**Copy**: The copy button copies the password to clipboard for ease of use.

**Save**: The Save button saves the password in SQLite database with a name for its identification.

**Share** : You can share your generated password across multiple medias (Yet to be completed )

This screen also consists of Option menu, which has three options, 
**Saved Passwords**: This is the activity where user can have access to all the saved password. This is the pattern lock protected activity.

**Settings**: From Settings the user can customize the generated password according to his/ her needs.

**Set Pattern**: This screen allows user to set a pattern lock for saved password.

## Settings
This is the Settings screen of the app where user can customize the generation of password as per his/her needs. The settings are as follows:
- **Uppercase:** By selecting this checkbox the password generated will contain Uppercase letters from A-Z
- **Lowercase:** By selecting this checkbox the password generated will contain Lowecase letters from a-z
- **Numbers:** By selecting this checkbox the password generated will contain numbers from 0 to 9
- **Spaces:** Password will contain space.
- **Special** Symbols: By selecting this checkbox the password generated will contain special symbols like (!@#$%^&*_=+-/)
- **Prefix:** The generated password will have this user inputted String preceded before it.
- **Password Length:** Specifies the length of the generated password, default value is 10.

The Settings is achieved using the Google Developers Settings prefs, The selected setting are stored in Shared Preferences as key value pair and is available throughout the app.

## Saved Passwords

The saved passwords are guarded with a pattern lock which can be set with the help of user password from the set password option menu.
The Pattern lock mechanism is implemented by using the following library
```
https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView
```

The library uses paper dB in order to store the created pattern. If the pattern does not matches with the pattern that was set from the Set Pattern screen, a toast is shown to the user indicating that the pattern is incorrect, When the password pattern is correct i.e. matches with the pattern set, the user is navigated to the Saved password screen


## Brute Force

Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies. 
In simple terms, in this attack the system program tries all possible words to crack the password, say for instance if my password is ‘ben’, so the program will start with the following pattern.
aaa aab aac aad ……. aaz
aba aca ada… aza
baa bac bad…Baz etc

The pattern will continue to execute until it finds a match, and when the match is found say ‘ben’ in this case, the password is cracked.
The logic for this mechanism is simple, we pass an array of possible letters to the iterative while loop, these words are then appended and made a String, which is then tested with the password, if it matches, the password is cracked. We are also required to pass the length of the password.

In order to avoid brute forcing we generate Strong Random password, If the password are simple including only lowercase letters say ‘adam’ or any similar simple password, it can be cracked easily using the brute force mechanism, it may not take much time to crack that password, because the array which we will pass will include all small letters from a to z. The possible cases for 4 letter password with array of char a to z will be 475227.
We can increase the complexity of the password by adding Uppercase alphabets, numbers, special symbols, by doing so the character array increases in size, increasing the probability of the password strings and more possible outcomes, maybe in billions. The char array would be
canUse [] = {a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ‘  ‘,  !, #, $, %, ^, &, *}
This kind of password may take billions of iterations and one would need to keep the process running for more than a month continuously without any break.
So the password that are generated in our app are secure from any kind of brute force breach. One can also implement a mechanism which disables the login button on 3 fail attempt for some designated period say 1 minute.
In our app when the user registers, he is also asked some security questions, which are then used in the forgot password flow to login the Facebook like page.
On Forgot password screen there is a button in the bottom of the screen “BF”. On pressing this button the brute force code is executed and the password is cracked. All the applied attempted strings are logged in Android Monitor.
